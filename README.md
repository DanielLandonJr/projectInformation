# Project Information

Used to display helpful information about a project. I like to use this when doing videos with various lectures so that I can maintain notes about what I have watched/done.

Designed to be a stand alone library. All HTML/CSS will be generated as part of the javascript file.

Any external libraries needed for the project will also be loaded dynamically.

Eventually i want to use this like a class for multiple instances, as it stands that is really not a requirement for the project to work.
